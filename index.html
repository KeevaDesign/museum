                        <p class="king-content">Ramesses III, a pharaoh of the 20th Dynasty, ruled Egypt from 1186 to
                            1155 BC. He is celebrated for his decisive
                            victories over the Sea Peoples, preserving Egypt’s stability during a time of widespread
                            upheaval. His mortuary temple
                            at Medinet Habu is among the most well-preserved and provides invaluable insights into New
                            Kingdom art and religious
                            practices. Despite challenges late in his reign, Ramesses III’s military and administrative
                            efforts ensured his lasting
                            reputation as Egypt’s last great pharaoh.</p>
